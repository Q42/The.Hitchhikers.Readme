## ðŸš€ Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- [ASP.NET Core 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [`COMPUTERNAME` as environment variable](../documentation/GUIDE-FOR-SOMETHING.md)
- Node Version Manager ([Mac](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) | [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows))
- [SQL database with full-text indexes](../documentation/GUIDE-FOR-SOMETHING.md)

### Installation

- [Setup User Secrets](../documentation/GUIDE-FOR-SOMETHING.md)

### Development

The new website consists of the 3 (runnable) projects: `VanGogh.Web`, `VanGogh.IIIFServer`, and `VanGogh.Cms`. Please run Web/Cms over https, because not everything works without https.

- [Build or watch the Cms front-end](../documentation/GUIDE-FOR-SOMETHING.md)

- Run the projects in your IDE
- Go to https://localhost:21001 for the website, go to https://localhost:21000 for the Cms and have fun!
### Deployment

Deploys to environments can be done in [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com).
When doing a deploy to production, make sure to inform the product owner about potential downtime of the website/cms.

### Translations

All translated content is stored inside the project `VanGogh.Domain`'s `Resource/R.resx`
and `Resource/R.en.resx`. When entries are added to these files, Rider automatically generates
C# code. There is a unit test (look for `RTests`) that checks if translations exist in all languages.

### Migrations

To generate a migration, be sure to have the latest EF tools installed globally
(run `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ef`), and then go into the folder
`VanGogh` and execute:

```
dotnet ef migrations add MIGRATIONNAME
```
